                       SRv6 Addressing Guidelines
          draft-doe-srv6ops-srv6-addressing-guidelines-latest

Abstract

   This document provides operational guidelines for designing Segment
   Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) addressing plans in
   Internet-service-provider backbones of up to 50 000 nodes.  It
   specifies a compressed Segment Identifier (C-SID) locator structure
   (F3216) that encodes Flex-Algo, Region-ID, Site-ID and Node-ID inside
   a fixed /48 locator while leaving space for Local and Global C-SIDs.
   An “ultra-scale” profile (~300 000 nodes) using End.LBS locator-block
   swap is also defined.  The aim is to accelerate brown-field SRv6
   migrations by offering deterministic field carving, summarisation
   rules and actionable operational guidance.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 offers a vast 128-bit space, allowing operators to build
   *hierarchical address plans* that align with their physical and
   operational topology.  When each byte has a clear meaning—Domain-ID,
   Region, Flex-Algo, Site-Set, Node—summaries fall naturally at region
   borders and troubleshooting becomes visual.

   A well-designed SRv6 addressing plan underpins summarisation, fast
   convergence, traffic-engineering flexibility and security filtering.
   For operators migrating from legacy MPLS or flat IPv6 (_brown-field_
   environments), renumbering entire domains is rarely feasible.  The
   scheme described here overlays gracefully on top of existing
   allocations: individual domain and regions or sites can migrate
   incrementally without a network-wide flag-day.

   Using *Unique Local Address (ULA)* space keeps infrastructure SIDs
   off the public Internet, limiting the blast-radius of route leaks or
   spoofing.  A Global-Unicast scheme is possible but demands airtight
   RPKI and strict ingress filters; it is therefore _NOT RECOMMENDED_
   unless strong business drivers outweigh the risk. _RFC 9602_
   specifies _5F00::/16_ for operators willing to deploy new strict edge
   ACLs and ROA is also a viable option.

   The *C-SID* paradigm compresses 16-bit Segment Identifiers inside a
   /48 locator—balancing header overhead with FIB scale while allowing
   deterministic summarisation.

2.  Terminology

   This glossary maps each field or acronym to its role in the
   hierarchical IPv6 structure so readers can follow subsequent sections
   without ambiguity.

   *  C-SID: 16-bit Compressed Segment Identifier

   *  Locator-Block: Uppermost bits that identify an SRv6 domain

   *  Flex-Algo: IGP Flexible Algorithm ID

   *  Region-ID: 8-bit value (bits 17-24) grouping sites

   *  *Set (SS)*: 256 C-SIDs (one /40) sizing a site; even = GIB, odd =
      LIB

   *  GIB: Global-ID Block — even-indexed Sets carrying global C-SIDs

   *  LIB: Local-ID Block — odd-indexed Sets filtered at Region edge

   *  SRv6 Site-ID: Byte-sized identifier for a POP cluster

   *  End.LBS: Endpoint behaviour performing Locator-Block Swap
