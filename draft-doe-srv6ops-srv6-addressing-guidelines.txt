                       SRv6 Addressing Guidelines
          draft-doe-srv6ops-srv6-addressing-guidelines-latest

Abstract

   This document provides operational guidelines for designing Segment
   Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) addressing plans in
   Internet-service-provider backbones of up to 50 000 nodes.  It
   specifies a compressed Segment Identifier (C-SID) locator structure
   (F3216) that encodes Flex-Algo, Region-ID, Site-ID and Node-ID inside
   a fixed /48 locator while leaving space for Local and Global C-SIDs.
   An “ultra-scale” profile (~300 000 nodes) using End.LBS locator-block
   swap is also defined.  The aim is to accelerate brown-field SRv6
   migrations by offering deterministic field carving, summarisation
   rules and actionable operational guidance.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 offers a vast 128-bit space, allowing operators to build
   *hierarchical address plans* that align with their physical and
   operational topology.  When each byte has a clear meaning—Domain-ID,
   Region, Flex-Algo, Site-Set, Node—summaries fall naturally at region
   borders and troubleshooting becomes visual.

   A well-designed SRv6 addressing plan underpins summarisation, fast
   convergence, traffic-engineering flexibility and security filtering.
   For operators migrating from legacy MPLS or flat IPv6 (_brown-field_
   environments), renumbering entire domains is rarely feasible.  The
   scheme described here overlays gracefully on top of existing
   allocations: individual domain and regions or sites can migrate
   incrementally without a network-wide flag-day.

   Using *Unique Local Address (ULA)* space keeps infrastructure SIDs
   off the public Internet, limiting the blast-radius of route leaks or
   spoofing.  A Global-Unicast scheme is possible but demands airtight
   RPKI and strict ingress filters; it is therefore _NOT RECOMMENDED_
   unless strong business drivers outweigh the risk.  RFC9602 specifies
   _5F00::/16_ for operators willing to deploy new strict at their
   border and edge ACLs ROA is also a viable option.

   The *C-SID* paradigm compresses 16-bit Segment Identifiers inside a
   /48 locator—balancing header overhead with FIB scale while allowing
   deterministic summarisation.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This glossary maps each field or acronym to its role in the
   hierarchical IPv6 structure so readers can follow subsequent sections
   without ambiguity.

   *  C-SID: 16-bit Compressed Segment Identifier

   *  Locator-Block: Uppermost bits that identify an SRv6 domain

   *  Flex-Algo: IGP Flexible Algorithm ID

   *  Region-ID: 8-bit value (bits 17-24) grouping sites

   *  *Set (SS)*: 256 C-SIDs (one /40) sizing a site; even = GIB, odd =
      LIB

   *  GIB: Global-ID Block — even-indexed Sets carrying global C-SIDs

   *  LIB: Local-ID Block — odd-indexed Sets filtered at Region edge

   *  SRv6 Site-ID: Byte-sized identifier for a POP cluster

   *  End.LBS: Endpoint behaviour performing Locator-Block Swap

4.  Design Goals and Requirements

   The five goals below justify every bit choice in the locator.  They
   translate generic IPv6 abundance into a practical, byte-aligned
   hierarchy that scales smoothly from small POPs to continental C-SID
   domains.

   *  _G1: – Scalable Aggregation_ ≤ 3 new routes in the core after any
      failure.

   *  _G2: – Per-Node /48 Locator_ Preserves /64 for services and /96
      for locals while capping FIB size.

   *  _G3: – Flex-Algo Plane Parity_ Bit positions identical across
      planes.

   *  _G4: – Global vs Local Split_ Even Sets = Global C-SIDs, odd Sets
      = Local C-SIDs.

   *  _G5: – Seamless Domain Stitching_ End.LBS swaps blocks without SRH
      growth.

5.  CSID Address-Encoding Framework (F3216)

   This section converts theory into byte boundaries, showing exactly
   *how* IPv6 bit-richness is partitioned into a multi-level hierarchy
   (Global-ID → Region → Flex-Algo → Site-Set → Node).

   The 128-bit SRv6 locator is split into a 64-bit _network_ part and a
   64-bit _host_ part.  The network part encodes Domain-ID, Region-ID,
   Flex-Algo, Set and Node-ID in byte-aligned fields.

5.1.  Locator Structure and Field Encoding (ULA-model)

   The diagram below shows, byte-by-byte, how an SRv6 locator encodes
   the hierarchy described in Section 4.  Reading the hexadecimal
   address reveals the Domain, Region, Flex-Algo, Set and Node values
   without a lookup table.

   Byte 0 1 2 3 4 5 6-15 Bits 0-7 8-15 16-23 24-31 32-39 40-47 (host
   part) +---+---+----+----+----+----+----------------+ |fd | D |Reg |
   FA | SS | NN | host64 |
   +---+---+----+----+----+----+----------------+

           +=======+=======+===================================+
           | Field | Bits  | Purpose                           |
           +=======+=======+===================================+
           | fd    | 0-7   | ULA prefix keeps locators private |
           +-------+-------+-----------------------------------+
           | D     | 8-15  | *Domain-ID*                       |
           +-------+-------+-----------------------------------+
           | Reg   | 16-23 | *Region-ID*                       |
           +-------+-------+-----------------------------------+
           | FA    | 24-31 | *Flex-Algo*                       |
           +-------+-------+-----------------------------------+
           | SS    | 32-39 | *Set (SS)*                        |
           +-------+-------+-----------------------------------+
           | NN    | 40-47 | *Node-ID* (/48 locator)           |
           +-------+-------+-----------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   _Smaller networks:_ Operators that do not require multiple domains or
   regional partitions can leave *Domain-ID* and/or *Region-ID* set to
   0x00.  The byte-aligned masks still summarise cleanly, and all
   downstream fields remain valid.
