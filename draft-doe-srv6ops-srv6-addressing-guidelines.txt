          draft-doe-srv6ops-srv6-addressing-guidelines-latest

Abstract

   This document provides operational guidelines for designing Segment
   Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) addressing plans in
   Internet-service-provider backbones of up to 50 000 nodes.  It
   specifies a compressed Segment Identifier (C-SID) locator structure
   (F3216) that encodes Flex-Algo, Region-ID, Site-ID and Node-ID inside
   a fixed /48 locator while leaving space for Local and Global C-SIDs.
   The aim is to accelerate brown-field SRv6 migrations by offering
   deterministic field carving, summarisation rules and actionable
   operational guidance.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 offers a vast 128-bit space, allowing operators to build
   *hierarchical address plans* that align with their physical and
   operational topology.  When each byte has a clear meaning—Domain-ID,
   Region, Flex-Algo, Site-Set, Node—summaries fall naturally at region
   borders and troubleshooting becomes visual.

   A well-designed SRv6 addressing plan underpins summarisation, fast
   convergence, traffic-engineering flexibility and security filtering.
   For operators migrating from legacy MPLS or flat IPv6 (_brown-field_
   environments), renumbering entire domains is rarely feasible.  The
   scheme described here overlays gracefully on top of existing
   allocations: individual domain and regions or sites can migrate
   incrementally without a network-wide flag-day.

   Using *Unique Local Address (ULA)* space keeps infrastructure SIDs
   off the public Internet, limiting the blast-radius of route leaks or
   spoofing.  A Global-Unicast scheme is possible but demands airtight
   RPKI and strict ingress filters; it is therefore _NOT RECOMMENDED_
   unless strong business drivers outweigh the risk.  RFC9602 specifies
   _5F00::/16_ for operators willing to deploy new strict at their
   border and edge ACLs ROA is also a viable option.

   The *C-SID* paradigm compresses 16-bit Segment Identifiers inside a
   /48 locator—balancing header overhead with FIB scale while allowing
   deterministic summarisation.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This glossary maps each field or acronym to its role in the
   hierarchical IPv6 structure so readers can follow subsequent sections
   without ambiguity.

   *  C-SID: 16-bit Compressed Segment Identifier

   *  Locator-Block: Uppermost bits that identify an SRv6 domain

   *  Flex-Algo: IGP Flexible Algorithm ID

   *  Region-ID: 8-bit value (bits 17-24) grouping sites

   *  *Set (SS)*: 256 C-SIDs (one /40) sizing a site; even = GIB, odd =
      LIB

   *  GIB: Global-ID Block — even-indexed Sets carrying global C-SIDs

   *  LIB: Local-ID Block — odd-indexed Sets filtered at Region edge

   *  SRv6 Site-ID: Byte-sized identifier for a POP cluster

4.  Design Goals and Requirements

   The five goals below justify every bit choice in the locator.  They
   translate generic IPv6 abundance into a practical, byte-aligned
   hierarchy that scales smoothly from small POPs to continental C-SID
   domains.

   *  _G1: – Scalable Aggregation_ ≤ 3 new routes in the core after any
      failure.

   *  _G2: – Per-Node /48 Locator_ Preserves /64 for services and /96
      for locals while capping FIB size.

   *  _G3: – Flex-Algo Plane Parity_ Bit positions identical across
      planes.

   *  _G4: – Global vs Local Split_ Even Sets = Global C-SIDs, odd Sets
      = Local C-SIDs.

5.  CSID Address-Encoding Framework (F3216)

   This section converts theory into byte boundaries, showing exactly
   *how* IPv6 bit-richness is partitioned into a multi-level hierarchy
   (Global-ID → Region → Flex-Algo → Site-Set → Node).

   The 128-bit SRv6 locator is split into a 64-bit _network_ part and a
   64-bit _host_ part.  The network part encodes Domain-ID, Region-ID,
   Flex-Algo, Set and Node-ID in byte-aligned fields.

5.1.  Locator Structure and Field Encoding (ULA-model)

   The diagram below shows, byte-by-byte, how an SRv6 locator encodes
   the hierarchy described in Section 4.  Reading the hexadecimal
   address reveals the Domain, Region, Flex-Algo, Set and Node values
   without a lookup table.

   Byte 0 1 2 3 4 5 6-15 Bits 0-7 8-15 16-23 24-31 32-39 40-47 (host
   part) +---+---+----+----+----+----+----------------+ |fd | D |Reg |
   FA | ST | NN | host64 |
   +---+---+----+----+----+----+----------------+

          +=======+=======+=====================================+
          | Field | Bits  | Purpose                             |
          +=======+=======+=====================================+
          | fd    | 0-7   | *ULA prefix keeps locators private* |
          +-------+-------+-------------------------------------+
          | D     | 8-15  | *Domain-ID*                         |
          +-------+-------+-------------------------------------+
          | Reg   | 16-23 | *Region-ID*                         |
          +-------+-------+-------------------------------------+
          | FA    | 24-31 | *Flex-Algo*                         |
          +-------+-------+-------------------------------------+
          | ST    | 32-39 | *Set (ST)*                          |
          +-------+-------+-------------------------------------+
          | NN    | 40-47 | *Node-ID* (/48 locator)             |
          +-------+-------+-------------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   _Smaller networks:_ Operators that do not require multiple domains or
   regional partitions can leave *Domain-ID* and/or *Region-ID* set to
   0x00.  The byte-aligned masks still summarise cleanly, and all
   downstream fields remain valid.

5.2.  Locator Structure for RFC 9602 (5F00::/16-model)

   Under _5F00::/16_, the first 16 bits are fixed.  The locator
   therefore pushes the hierarchy one half-byte to the right:

   Nibbles (4 bits) host part 0 1 2 3 4 5 6-15
   +----+----+-----+------+-------+----+----------------+ | 5F | 00 |
   D | R | FA | ST | NN | host64 |
   +----+----+-----+------+-------+----+----------------+ Bits 0-15
   fixed 16-19 20-23 24-31 32-39 40-47

   *  D (Domain-ID) – 4 bits → up to *15 domains* (0x1-0xF)

   *  R (Region-ID) – 4 bits → *15 regions* per domain (0x1-0xF)

   *  FA (Flex-Algo) – full byte (24-31)

   *  ST / NN – identical meaning as in Section 4.1

   Because the first two bytes are locked (_5F00_), Domain and Region
   live in the third byte.  Flex-Algo retains a full byte so existing
   deployments need no change.  ISPs can subdivide further—for example
   using the lower nibble of Flex-Algo as a sub-region key—while keeping
   summaries on nibble boundaries.

6.  Deployment Profiles

   The Set (SS) byte lets planners scale by powers of 256: *one even Set
   supports up to 256 node locators*.  Sizing logic:

    • Small POP (≤256 nodes): 1 even Set  → summary /40
    • Medium POP (257-512 nodes): 2 even Sets → summary /39
    • Large POP (513-1024 nodes): 4 even Sets → summary /38

   The examples below show the Sets allocated and the summary route that
   each Region injects into IS-IS Level 2.

6.1.  Worked Examples (Region-ID 0x05, Flex-Algo 0)

6.1.1.  Small Site – 110 routers

   • Set 0x0600 → fd00:0500:0600::/40 • *Summary injected into L2:*
   fd00:0500:0600::/40

6.1.2.  Medium Site – 315 routers

   • Sets 0x0A00–0x0A10 → fd00:0500:0a00::/39 • *Summary injected into
   L2:* fd00:0500:0a00::/39

6.1.3.  Large Site – 890 routers

   • Sets 0x1000–0x1030 → fd00:0500:1000::/38 • *Summary injected into
   L2:* fd00:0500:1000::/38

7.  Summarisation Best Practices

   IPv6 gives ample room to carve hierarchical blocks, but the hierarchy
   is only useful if _each layer advertises exactly one summary into the
   layer above_.  The guiding rule is *summarise at every 8-bit field
   boundary* so the mask aligns to a full byte.

   ┌─────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐ │ Topology │ Field mask │
   Prefix │ ├─────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤ │ Core AS │ /32 │
   Reg+FA │ │ Region POPs │ /38–/40 │ Set range │ │ Single node │ /48 │
   Node (NN) │ └─────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘

   *How the summarization flow*

   ## *Region → Core (IS-IS L2):* Every Region advertises one /32 per
   Flex-Algo.  The prefix is derived by masking after the FA byte so all
   downstream Sets collapse naturally.  A 300 k-node continental
   backbone therefore injects at most _3 × Regions_ routes into the
   core.

   ## *Site → Region (IS-IS L1):* Each Site advertises a summary that
   stops at the Set byte: /40 if it needs 1 Set (Small), /39 if it needs
   2 Sets (Medium), /38 if it needs 4 Sets (Large).  These prefixes
   never leave the Region.

   ## *Core → Region (downward):* The core leaks only the /32s back into
   all Regions.  Routers discard any packet whose destination is outside
   those blocks—protecting against accidental leaks.

   *Provider-wide Aggregate.* ASBRs SHOULD also originate a single
   prefix that covers the _entire_ ISP address block (e.g., fd00::/20 or
   the equivalent GUA).  Advertising this grand summary into the core
   and to upstream transit providers adds a final safety net—any stray
   Internet route leak that re-enters the network will be suppressed at
   Region borders because it can never be more specific than the /32s
   already authorised inside the domain.

   *TE exception.* Operators may temporarily leak a specific /39 into
   the core for traffic-engineering.  Automation MUST withdraw the
   prefix after use to prevent FIB bloat.

   *Error containment.* Because the summary masks are byte-aligned, a
   single mis-originated /48 cannot cross a Region boundary—either the
   packet is caught by a default-drop rule or it is outside the /32
   admitted by the core.

8.  Other Operational Considerations

   In an IPv6-only backbone the control-plane still needs several legacy
   32-bit identifiers—IS-IS NET-ID, BGP router-ID, IS-IS System-ID—that
   were traditionally filled with an IPv4 loopback.  Deriving these
   values *directly from the hierarchical locator0* eliminates manual
   spreadsheets and guarantees internal consistency.  The examples below
   use the _medium-site_ case from Section 5.1.2:

    • Region-ID 0x05, Flex-Algo 0
    • Set 0x0A10, Node 0x13B
    • locator0 → **fd00:0500:0a13::/48**
    • L2 summary → **fd00:0500:0a00::/39**

8.1.  Loopback Address and NET-ID/Router-ID Derivation

   An IPv6-only backbone still requires legacy 32-bit identifiers for
   IS-IS NET-ID and BGP router-ID.  Deriving these directly from the
   hierarchical locator eliminates manual spreadsheets and guarantees
   consistency.

   *  Example (Medium Site from Section 5.1.2):

      -  Region-ID = 0x05, Flex-Algo = 0x00

      -  ST = 0x0A, Node-ID = 0x13B (hex)

      -  locator0 = fd00:0500:0A13::/48

      -  L1 summary = fd00:0500:0A00::/39

   *  Loopback:

      -  Rule: Loopback = locator0 + ::1/128 from locator0.

      -  Example: fd00:0500:0A13::1/128

      -  Because this resides inside the /48 advertised by IS-IS, no
         additional loopback prefix is needed (reduces FIB noise)

   *  IS-IS NET-ID:

      -  Format: 49.Area-ID.System-ID.00

      -  Area-ID: Operator-defined (e.g., area 10)

      -  System-ID: Last three bytes of locator0, nibble-grouped:
         locator0 (0A13:0B00:0000) → System-ID = 0A13.0B00.00

      -  NET-ID = 49.10.0A13.0B00.00

   *  Router-ID (BGP & IS-IS):

      -  Method: Use lower 32 bits of loopback, rendered in dotted-
         decimal.

      -  Loopback low-32 bits = 0x00000A13 → 0.0.10.19

      -  BGP Router-ID = 0.0.10.19

      -  IS-IS System-ID (48-bit alt) = 0000.0A13.0000

   Note: Mismatches between locator0, loopback, and router-ID indicate
   configuration typos and aid in audits.

9.  Security Considerations

   The hierarchical IP addressing plan proposed here offers natural ACL
   boundaries—and operators should leverage them to minimize security
   risk:

   *  Byte-Aligned Summaries as ACL Anchors

      Because locators and summaries align on full-byte boundaries
      (e.g., /32 for Region, /48 for Site), ACLs can match on these
      exact prefixes.  For example, an ACL permitting fd00:0500::/32
      automatically allows all Site- and Node-level prefixes under
      Region 05 but denies anything outside.  Maintaining ACLs at each
      Region border is therefore straightforward and less error-prone
      than arbitrary masks.

   *  Logging and Periodic Audits

      Log locator assignments and summary changes at each aggregation
      level.  Periodically audit ACLs to ensure they align with the
      current hierarchy (e.g., confirm that all allowed /48s fall under
      their parent /32).  This catch-all approach helps identify any
      unauthorized or stale entries before they compromise security.

   By combining byte-aligned summarization with simple ACL rules at
   Region or Site boundaries, operators can enforce strict filtering
   with minimal complexity, leveraging the hierarchical plan to make ACL
   configuration both robust and scalable.
